  Smart navigation with GPS, real-time sensing, and automatic actions across the field.

- **Pest, Disease & Weed Detection + Removal**  
  Camera-based detection using computer vision with mechanical removal modules.

- **Fertilizer Deficiency Monitoring**  
  Soil sensors analyze nutrient levels to recommend targeted fertilization.

- **Eco-Irrigation**  
  Reuses sewage water through an inbuilt filtration system for sustainable irrigation.

- **Web App Interface**  
  Live camera streaming, geo-tagged alerts, and control panel accessible from any device.

- **Real-time Geo-Mapping**  
  Identifies and highlights problem zones with coordinates for precision action.
